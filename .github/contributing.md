## Pull Requests
- **All PRs must have a description.** Please make sure the description is accurate. If later updates to a PR include additional changes, you should update the description to reflect these changes.
- **All PRs must include a link to JIRA in the description.** If a ticket does not exist, please create one.
- **All PRs must include information on how the change can be tested.** You should provide a detailed list of steps on how to test that would be clear to someone unfamiliar with the functionality. Alternatively, you can provide a video demonstrating these steps.
- **All PRs must contain screenshot(s) of any UI changes.** When the PR is opened, provide any screenshots in the PR details. As changes are made to the UI in response to requests, leave an updated screenshot as a comment on the PR. This allows people to visually follow along and provide appropriate UI feedback without having to set up a test environment. Make sure you account for different states. Alternatively, you can provide a video walkthrough.
- **Tests should not be skipped!** If you feel that there is a valid reason to skip a test, please be sure to provide your justification.
- **PRs with module version bumps should have a link to the release notes and a summary of notable changes.**
- **Any PR that doesn't meet the criteria in this list should be converted to a draft PR until it is ready to go.**
